> **Ask your local data what it knows.** A local-first desktop app for **macOS and Windows** that opens your databases, MemPalace, and config files — and lets you ask questions in plain English.

## ✨ What it does

Alchemist turns your local data into a conversation. Open a SQLite database, point it at your MemPalace, or drop in a YAML file — then just ask questions.

**Drop in a database, ask a question, get answers.** No cloud, no accounts, no data leaves your machine.

```
You: "How many users signed up last month?"
Alchemist: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE created_at >= date('now', '-30 days')
           → 1,247 users
```

### Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 🗄️ **SQLite** | Open any `.db` or `.sqlite` file — read-only, safe, can't accidentally modify your data |
| 🧠 **MemPalace** | Connect to your palace, browse wings and rooms, search by meaning |
| 💬 **Natural language** | Just ask. Alchemist generates safe SQL from your question |
| 🔍 **SQL preview** | See the SQL before it runs. Edit it, cancel it, or approve it |
| 📊 **Charts** | Results as bar, line, or pie charts — auto-detects numeric columns |
| ✨ **Saved spells** | Name and reuse your best queries across sessions |
| 🤖 **Your model, your rules** | Ollama (local), OpenAI, Google Gemini, DeepSeek — or any OpenAI-compatible provider |
| 🔒 **Private by design** | No telemetry, no accounts, no cloud dependency. Your keys stay on your machine |
| 💻 **Mac & Windows** | One app, both platforms — same witchy experience on macOS 13+ and Windows 10/11 |

## 🚀 Quick start

### Download

Grab the latest build for your computer from [Releases](https://github.com/witchdaddylabs/alchemist/releases) — no account, no sign-up, nothing to configure. Just download and open.

**🪟 Windows 10 / 11**
Download `Alchemist_x64-setup.exe`, double-click it, and click through the installer. Alchemist then lives in your Start menu, ready to go.

**🍎 macOS 13+ (Ventura or later — Apple Silicon or Intel)**
Download the `.dmg`, open it, and drag Alchemist into your Applications folder.

*That's the whole setup. Open the app and you're ready for the next step.*

### Setup a provider

Alchemist needs an AI model to generate queries from your questions.

**Local (free, private):**
1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.2`
3. Open Alchemist — Ollama is auto-detected

**Cloud (bring your own key):**
- OpenAI, Google AI Studio, DeepSeek — or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Groq, Together, vLLM, etc.)
- Add your API key in Settings → pick a provider

</div>

### Your first query

1. **Open Alchemist** — it auto-loads MemPalace if you have one
2. **Or drag a database** — any `.db` file onto the vault screen
3. **Type a question** — "show me my tables" or "how many records?"
4. **Review the SQL** — Alchemist shows you what it's about to run
5. **Hit Run** — see results as a table or chart
6. **Save it** — click "Save as Spell" to reuse later

## 🛠️ Development

Curious enough to run it from source — or build your own copy? You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Rust](https://rustup.rs) installed first (on Windows, that also means the Microsoft C++ Build Tools — the Rust installer points you to them).

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/witchdaddylabs/alchemist.git
cd alchemist
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

**Windows:** we've bundled a couple of double-click-friendly helper scripts so you don't have to memorise any commands:

- **`run-windows.bat`** — launches the app. It checks you've got everything, installs what's missing, and opens Alchemist.
- **`build-windows.ps1`** — builds your very own installer at `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/`.

There is also a report-only duplicate audit helper for local folder trees:

```bash
npm run audit:duplicates -- --root "/path/to/folder"
```

### Stack

| Layer | What |
|-------|------|
| Desktop | **Tauri v2** — lightweight native shell |
| Frontend | **React 19**, **TypeScript**, **Vite** |
| UI | **shadcn/ui** (dark mode, purple neon accents) |
| State | **Zustand** |
| Backend | **Rust** — SQLite, ChromaDB, MemPalace parsing |
| SQL safety | **sqlparser-rs** — SELECT-only, single statement, auto-LIMIT |
| AI providers | Ollama, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, custom OpenAI-compatible |
| Auto-update | **tauri-plugin-updater** — checks GitHub Releases on launch |

## 🔐 Security

- **Read-only by design** — SQLite opened with `SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY`
- **SQL validation** — every query parsed by `sqlparser-rs`: blocks writes, multi-statements, dangerous pragmas
- **Keys stay local** — on macOS your API keys live in the system Keychain; on Windows they're kept in your private user folder (`%USERPROFILE%\.alchemist`). Either way, they never leave your machine
- **No telemetry** — zero analytics, crash reporting, or network calls to WDL servers
- **Open source** — MIT licensed. Build it yourself if you want

## 🧩 What's next?

Alchemist is fully functional and shippable. A few things we're thinking about:

| Feature | Why it's cool |
|---------|---------------|
| **Pagination** | Load-more for results over 1,000 rows |
| **Multi-source queries** | Cross-reference SQLite + ChromaDB in one chat |
| **Plugin architecture** | Postgres, MySQL, CSV support as plugins |
| **Native export dialog** | macOS save dialog for CSV/JSON exports |
